== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Comment Runner work? =

Comment Runner checks WordPress comments for HTML hyperlinks.
If one is found, the comment is placed in your comment-"trash" folder.
This technique is effective because it denies spammers what they're after -- an SEO advantage through hyperlinks and lead generation through email.

Additionally, Comment Runner hides the author-URL input box that's visible by default in WordPress.
In a perfect world, this would allow your readers to submit their blog (as a link) to a comment he/she submitted.
Unfortunately, this is now abused by bots.

By hiding it (the author-URL input box), a "real" user can't add content.
So, if this plugin detects content in the input box, it can conclude with certainty that the message is spam and mark it as "trash."
